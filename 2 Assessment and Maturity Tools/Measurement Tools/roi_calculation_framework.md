## 2. ROI Calculation Framework and Methodology

### 2.1 ROI Calculation Foundation

#### 2.1.1 Core ROI Formula and Components
**Basic ROI Calculation:**
```
ROI (%) = ((Total Benefits - Total Costs) / Total Costs) × 100

Where:
Total Benefits = Direct Financial Benefits + Indirect Benefits + Risk Mitigation Value
Total Costs = Implementation Costs + Ongoing Operational Costs + Opportunity Costs
```

**Advanced ROI Metrics:**
```
Net Present Value (NPV) = Σ(Benefits_t - Costs_t) / (1 + discount_rate)^t

Internal Rate of Return (IRR) = Rate where NPV = 0

Payback Period = Initial Investment / Average Annual Cash Flow

Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR) = Present Value of Benefits / Present Value of Costs
```

**Risk-Adjusted ROI:**
```
Risk-Adjusted ROI = (Expected Benefits × Probability of Success - Total Costs) / Total Costs × 100

Expected Value = Σ(Scenario_Value × Scenario_Probability)
```

#### 2.1.2 Calculation Parameters and Assumptions
**Time Frame and Analysis Period:**
- **Analysis Period:** 3-5 years for comprehensive governance programs
- **Reporting Frequency:** Monthly tracking, quarterly reporting, annual review
- **Baseline Period:** 12-24 months of pre-implementation data
- **Benefit Realization Timeline:** Phased benefit recognition over implementation period

**Financial Parameters:**
- **Discount Rate:** Organization's weighted average cost of capital (WACC) or hurdle rate
- **Inflation Rate:** Expected annual inflation rate for cost and benefit adjustments
- **Tax Rate:** Applicable corporate tax rate for after-tax calculations
- **Currency and Exchange Rates:** Base currency and foreign exchange considerations

**Probability and Risk Factors:**
- **Implementation Success Probability:** Risk-adjusted likelihood of successful implementation
- **Benefit Realization Probability:** Probability of achieving projected benefits
- **Risk Mitigation Effectiveness:** Expected effectiveness of risk reduction measures
- **Uncertainty Factors:** Range of scenarios and sensitivity analysis parameters
