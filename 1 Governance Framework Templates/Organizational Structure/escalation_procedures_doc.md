## 1. Purpose and Scope

### 1.1 Purpose

- Resource investment in resolution should align with business value at risk
- Communication intensity should reflect stakeholder impact and urgency

**Transparency:**
- All stakeholders must understand escalation status and next steps

- Lessons learned should be captured and shared to prevent recurrence

**Accountability:**
- Clear ownership must be established at each escalation level
- Decision-makers must have appropriate authority and expertise
